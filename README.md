# ThePiWatch

In short, The PiWatch is a smart watch powered by the Raspberry Pi Zero W. It sports a 2.8in Capacitive touch TFT Display (320x240 resolution) along with some future plans for a joystick, speakers, and possibly a microphone. The whole thing runs on a 2400 maH LiPo battery, so itâ€™s completely portable!
